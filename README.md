## Shadowrun6Forge
This app is in **early alpha** at this stage. 
I'm not a professional developer, so sorry about the beauty or clarity of the code.
I use the rules of the French version for the code, even if you put the application in English.

**The aim is to facilitate the creation of Shadowrun 6 characters and their import into Foundry.**

If you'd like to participate or help out, feel free to go to issues or fork the code.

This project has no connection with [Catalyst Game Labs](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/), publisher of Shadowrun, or [Black Book Editions](https://black-book-editions.fr/catalogue.php?id=150), French publisher of Shadowrun.
